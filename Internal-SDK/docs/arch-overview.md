# Architecture Overview

The Internal API Gateway SDK is structured to facilitate secure and reliable communication with an enterprise API Gateway.

## Components
- **GatewayClient**: Core client interface for all HTTP communication.
- **Retry logic**: Ensures resiliency against transient errors.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for observability.
- **Config Layer**: YAML-driven configuration to support different environments.

## Design Principles
- **Security first**: Token-based authentication is required for all requests.
- **Simplicity**: Clean and minimal public interface.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with middleware, auth layers, or circuit breakers.
